  <p class="mb-6">Hi friend, welcome to my personal website! I&apos;m Simon, it&apos;s a pleasure to meet you ðŸ‘‹</p>
  <p class="mb-6">
    I&apos;m an IT professional based out of the greater Philadelphia area. I am currently a software engineer at LLUNA,
    a startup focused on driving team balance and belonging at work.

  <p class="mb-6">
    On this site, you'll find some information to (hopefully) get to know me better. While most of the content is
    focused on my IT career, I hope to introduce you to my growing hobby of photography soon enough.
